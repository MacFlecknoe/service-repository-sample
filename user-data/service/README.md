user-data-service
===========

Example implementation of service interface generated from wadl. Can be deployed into vanilla Tomcat server.

Some custom mapping of the marshalling provider needed to be done in order for this to work properly.

 	1. The DTO root elements needed to have root element names assigned to them as autogenerated classes are not marked as XmlRootElements by JAXB 
 	2. The JSON provider needed to be configured to ignore namespaces (this opens up the api up to naming collisions and so should be mapped to shorter names instead)
 	3. The root wrapper element for returned json needs to be dropped as its superfluous.
 	 
 See beans.xml for details.
